👨‍💻 I'm a software developer with a deep-seated passion for learning new skills and building functional, user-friendly applications.

💼 In my professional journey, I've gained substantial experience with ASP.NET and SQL Server, focusing on backend systems and continuously working to enhance functionality. I was also able to gain insight into the CI/CD processes.
