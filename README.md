## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

👨‍💻 As a software developer with a passionate drive for learning and building, I embarked on my programming adventure at just 15. Since then, I've embraced a multitude of technologies, with a strong focus on creating cohesive, user-centric applications.

💼 Professionally, I've worked extensively with ASP.NET and SQL Server, contributing to complex backend systems at Diligent Corporation. My passion lies in refining functionality and exploring the vast potential of the digital landscape.

🧰 My personal repositories reflect my journey through web and mobile app development with a stack that includes React, Flask, Express, and MongoDB, as well as ventures into cloud services.
